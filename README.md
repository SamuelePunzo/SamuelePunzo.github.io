# Hi there, I'm Samuele Punzo! 👋

[cite_start]I am a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence at the **University of Amsterdam (UvA)**[cite: 5, 28]. [cite_start]My primary research interests lie in **Explainable AI (XAI)**, with a specific focus on **mechanistic interpretability and applications in the biomedical field**[cite: 6].

[cite_start]Previously, I graduated with honors (110/110) in Computer Science from the University of Pisa [cite: 34, 36, 70][cite_start], where I ranked among the top 5% of students[cite: 72].

### 🔬 Research & Experience

Currently, I am focused on the intersection of AI and Healthcare/Biology:

* [cite_start]**Incoming Student Researcher @ ILLC (UvA):** Starting Jan 2026, I will be conducting research on **circuit-based mechanistic interpretability**[cite: 8, 9, 10, 11].
* **Research Assistant @ BioMedical and Health Informatics Lab (UniPi):** (Nov 2024 - Nov 2025)
    * [cite_start]Member of the Computational Health team working on the **MEDICA** and **PANS** projects[cite: 13, 14, 15].
    * [cite_start]Developing explainable ML pipelines for **scRNA-seq** and **Microarray** data to identify biomarkers for Multiple Sclerosis and PANS[cite: 17, 20].
    * [cite_start]Focusing on biological enrichment analysis tools (DAVID, StringDB, Cytoscape)[cite: 20].
