# Hi there, I'm Samuele Punzo! 👋

I am a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence at the **University of Amsterdam (UvA)**. My primary research interests lie in **Explainable AI (XAI)**, with a specific focus on **mechanistic interpretability and applications in the biomedical field**.

Previously, I graduated with honors (110/110) in Computer Science from the University of Pisa, where I ranked among the top 5% of students.

### 🔬 Research & Experience

Currently, I am focused on the intersection of AI and Healthcare/Biology:

* **Incoming Student Researcher @ ILLC (UvA):** Starting Jan 2026, I will be conducting research on **circuit-based mechanistic interpretability**.
* **Research Assistant @ BioMedical and Health Informatics Lab (UniPi):** (Nov 2024 - Nov 2025)
    * Member of the Computational Health team working on the **MEDICA** and **PANS** projects.
    * Developing explainable ML pipelines for **scRNA-seq** and **Microarray** data to identify biomarkers for Multiple Sclerosis and PANS.
    * Focusing on biological enrichment analysis tools (DAVID, StringDB, Cytoscape).
